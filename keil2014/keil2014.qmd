# The g-formula

# The data

The file `data.csv` was created using the SAS code from the Supplementary Material, and it corresponds to the person-period dataset mentioned in the manuscript.

```{r load-data}
# Data taken from the SM of the manuscript
dd <- read.csv(
  file = "keil2014/data.csv"
) |>
  tibble::as_tibble()
```
